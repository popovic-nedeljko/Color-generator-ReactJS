The React application allows users to generate color palettes based on an input color, providing a simple and customizable tool for web design and development.

The application takes an input color, converts it into different shades and tints using the 'Values' package, and displays the resulting color palette as a list of colored squares with their corresponding hex values and percentage weights.

Users can also copy the hex value of each color to their clipboard by clicking on the color square.

The React hooks, external package, and utility functions utilized in the application contribute to its smooth functionality and user-friendly interface.
